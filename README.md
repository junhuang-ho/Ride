AppStorage pattern moves all state variables to 1 file. It only saves on calling state variables in contract, but calling fn in contract or calling fn/state variables in libraries remains the same so not much bonus there. Overall Diamond Storage is still preferred as separates state variables by their functionality (in libraries).
